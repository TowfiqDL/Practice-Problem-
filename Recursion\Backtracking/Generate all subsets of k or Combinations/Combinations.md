Write a program which computes all size k subsets of {1, 2, .........., n } where k and n are Ptogram inputs. For example, iI k = 2 and n = 5, then the result is the following:
{{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {1, 5}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {2, 5}, {3, 4}, {3, 5}, {4, 5}}


Time Complexity : Time complexity for such problems are O(k*2^n), where n is the height of the recursive tree.
